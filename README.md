This repository contains Fiji (ImageJ) macros for automatic analysis of microscopy images. Their use is explained in detail in Zahumensky & Malinsky bioRxiv preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.28.587214

**Explanation of the Results table**
For each cell/ROI, multiple paramers are quantified. While a lot of the parameters obtained from *transversal (cross-sectional)* and *tangential* images are inherently different, a lot are common for the two image types. Therefore, they are pooled here into a single list, in alphabetical order.
