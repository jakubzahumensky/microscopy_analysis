This repository contains Fiji (ImageJ) macros for automatic analysis of microscopy images. Their use is explained in detail in Zahumensky & Malinsky bioRxiv preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.28.587214

# **Explanation of the Results table**  
For each cell/ROI, multiple paramers are quantified. As the *transversal (cross-sectional)* and *tangential* images show principally different things, the parameters decribing then are inherently different. At the same time, some parameters are common for the two image types. In the list below, they are grouped accordingly, and ordered as they are in the respective *Results table* for easier orientation.

## **Common parameters**

## **Parameters for *transversal* images**

## **Parameters for *tangential* images**
