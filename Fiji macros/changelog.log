ROI prep 9.0
- fixed the option to manually define ROIs

ROI prep 9.0 & Quantify 15.0
- changed the naming of ROISets to make them compatible with other quanification macros (e.g., Kymolyzer, currently under development)
- unified the naming style of functions

The new versions are not backward compatible with ROI prep 8.x and Quantify 14.x!
